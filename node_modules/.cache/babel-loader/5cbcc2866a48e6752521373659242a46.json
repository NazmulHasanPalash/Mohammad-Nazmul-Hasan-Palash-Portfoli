Weights, prices, costs, number of items sold, employee names, product names, addresses, tax codes, registration marks, and so on are all examples of data. In computing, data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing. Data, in the context of today's computers and transmission media, is information that has been converted into binary digital form. It is acceptable to use data as a singular or plural subject. Raw data is a term used to describe data in its most basic digital format. The notion of data in computing stems from the work of Claude Shannon, an American mathematician known as the father of information theory. He pioneered binary digital concepts based on the use of two-valued Boolean logic in electronic circuits. CPUs, semiconductor memories, disk drives, and many of the peripheral devices used in computing today are all based on binary digit formats. Punch cards were used as early computer input for both control and data, followed by magnetic tape and hard disks. (Jack Voughan, 31 July 2019, Tech Target) Database: The database is a structured collection of data that has been organized to make it easily accessible, manageable, and up to date. In layman's terms, a database is a location where data is stored. The library is the best analogy. The library has a large collection of books of various genres; in this case, the library is a database, and the books are the data. Since their inception in the early 1960s, databases have evolved dramatically. The first systems used to store and manipulate data were navigational databases such as the Hierarchical database and the Network database. Despite the fact that these early systems were rigid, Relational databases were very popular in the early 1980s, and were later followed by object-oriented databases. NoSQL databases have recently emerged as a response to the growth of the internet and the need for faster speed and processing of unstructured data. Cloud databases and self-driving databases are breaking new ground in terms of how data is collected, stored, managed, and utilized. Let's look at an example of a database: A database is used by an online website API to store information about people, phone numbers, and other contact information and features. A database is a structured collection of information or data that is typically stored electronically in a computer system. (Vaishnavi MR, 27 Nov 2019, Edureka) Database Management System (DBMS): A database management system (DBMS) is a set of programs that allows users to create and maintain databases; it also includes a collection of interconnected data and a set of programs to access that data. As a result, a database management system (DBMS) is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, building, and manipulating databases for various applications. A DBMS's primary goal is to provide an environment for retrieving and storing database information that is both convenient and efficient to use. It serves as a link between the user of application programs on the one hand and the database on the other (Jagdish Chandra Patni, Hitesh Kumar Sharma, Ravi Tomar, Avita, P 251, E. 1, Katal, 27 Jan 2022, Database Management System). The DBMS manages incoming data, organizes it, and provides methods for users or other programs to modify or extract the data. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, SQL Server, and other DBMS are examples.\"\n                    }, void 0, false, {\n                      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                      lineNumber: 26,\n                      columnNumber: 45\n                    }, this)\n                  }, void 0, false, {\n                    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                    lineNumber: 24,\n                    columnNumber: 41\n                  }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n                    class: \"modal-footer\",\n                    children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"button\", {\n                      type: \"button\",\n                      class: \"btn btn-secondary\",\n                      \"data-bs-dismiss\": \"modal\",\n                      children: \"Close\"\n                    }, void 0, false, {\n                      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                      lineNumber: 72,\n                      columnNumber: 45\n                    }, this)\n                  }, void 0, false, {\n                    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                    lineNumber: 71,\n                    columnNumber: 41\n                  }, this)]\n                }, void 0, true, {\n                  fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                  lineNumber: 19,\n                  columnNumber: 37\n                }, this)\n              }, void 0, false, {\n                fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                lineNumber: 18,\n                columnNumber: 33\n              }, this)\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 17,\n              columnNumber: 29\n            }, this)]\n          }, void 0, true, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 11,\n            columnNumber: 25\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 9,\n          columnNumber: 21\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 8,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n        class: \"col\",\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n          class: \"card\",\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"img\", {\n            src: \"...\",\n            class: \"card-img-top\",\n            alt: \"...\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 82,\n            columnNumber: 25\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n            class: \"card-body\",\n            children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h5\", {\n              class: \"card-title\",\n              children: \"Card title\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 84,\n              columnNumber: 29\n            }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n              class: \"card-text\",\n              children: \"This is a longer card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content.

Cloud databases and self-driving databases are breaking new ground in\n                                                terms of how data is collected, stored, managed, and utilized. Let's look at an example of a\n                                                database: A database is used by an online website API to store information about people,\n                                                phone numbers, and other contact information and features. A database is a structured\n                                                collection of information or data that is typically stored electronically in a computer system.\n                                                (Vaishnavi MR, 27 Nov 2019, Edureka)\n                                                Database Management System (DBMS): A database management system (DBMS) is a set of\n                                                programs that allows users to create and maintain databases; it also includes a collection of\n                                                interconnected data and a set of programs to access that data. As a result, a database\n                                                management system (DBMS) is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the\n                                                processes of defining, building, and manipulating databases for various applications.\n                                                A DBMS's primary goal is to provide an environment for retrieving and storing database\n                                                information that is both convenient and efficient to use. It serves as a link between the user of\n                                                application programs on the one hand and the database on the other (Jagdish Chandra Patni,\n                                                Hitesh Kumar Sharma, Ravi Tomar, Avita, P 251, E. 1, Katal, 27 Jan 2022, Database\n                                                Management System). The DBMS manages incoming data, organizes it, and provides\n                                                methods for users or other programs to modify or extract the data.
